# Production Tools for Light Filter Assembly

### Asiga Internal Alignment & Calibration Tool
- Developed quality control & production tooling for light engine assembly precision
- Supports printer production with small customised handheld electronic tools for standardised, repeated methods
- Designed a multi-purpose reprogrammable platform based on Arduino Nano microcontroller
- Designed custom PCBs using Altium Designer

### Functionality & Requirements
| Alignment | Calibration |
| --- | --- |
- Initial sweep to loosen up internal gearing / determine if servo has major QC issues
- Determine & set a 90 degree angle operating range within servo angle limits
- Set servo's "engaged" position at the start of its operating angle range to mount filter holder
- Button toggling between "engaged" and "zero" positions
- Button control for laser diodes for checking filters are installed on assembly within a tolerance

### Calibration Tool Functionality
- Precise adjustment of "engaged" position of filter assembly when installed inside light engine
- Increment servo rotation (CW & CCW) with buttons
- Programmable degree incrementing resolution
- Power persistent servo position
- Toggle between new "engaged" position and "zero" positions
